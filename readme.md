# IfFastInjector v0.1
==========================

This project is a fork of the https://ffastinjector.codeplex.com/ library by David Walker (https://plus.google.com/109602553530284384616/posts).

The goal of this port is to convert the libary into a proper instance-based injector object as well as to add Ninjit style injection annotations.

For the first release, Multi and Map binders are not a goal.
